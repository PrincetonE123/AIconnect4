Description:
Connect 4 AI is a modified version of the classic Connect 4 game, designed as part of an AI Theory & Programming class project. 
The original game only supported Player vs. Player and Computer vs. Player modes. 
The task was to enhance the game by integrating an AI player using a uniform cost-search algorithm.

Features:

AI Integration: Added an AI opponent powered by a uniform cost-search algorithm to make intelligent moves.
One-Second Move Delay: Introduced a one-second delay between moves to allow players to visually follow the AI’s decision-making process.
Interactive GUI: Customized the game’s interface to display my name and class details.
User Selection: In the "AI vs CPU" mode, users can select the AI's first move, adding a layer of interactivity to the game.
Technologies Used:

JavaScript (for game logic and AI implementation)
HTML/CSS (for the user interface)
Uniform Cost-Search Algorithm (AI algorithm)


How to Run:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
If you want to run from visual studio code, change the launch.json file path to your device's directory.
Or open the index.html file in a browser.
Select the "AI vs CPU" mode and choose the AI’s first move to start the game.
